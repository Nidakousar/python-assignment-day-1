 Python variables:-

Creating Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Example 1 :-
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
